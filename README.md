**Metronome** is a game in which the objective is to click/tap exactly on beat. The gray circle flashes as a metronome, and its appearance is intended to coincide with the downbeat. Clicking/tapping anywhere on screen at that same moment means you win. Otherwise, the scoreboard shows how far off your last and best attempts were.
